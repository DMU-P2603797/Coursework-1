  <h1>The Simpsons Movie</h1>
  <!-- Had to put a h1 in, as this is the main title of my page. It needs to stand out. -->

<h2><a class="links" href ="Meet the Cast.html">Meet the Cast</a></h2>
<!-- I linked my homepage to my second page (meet the cast). I put the link in a heading element so, it will stand out better. I put my link in a class element, as I didn't want every link I have to look the same. -->

<h2>America's most loved cartoon family hits the big screen!</h2>

<!-- Put another H2 as I wanted it to be a subheading, and a sort of introduction as to what the paragraph is going to be about below -->

<p>In the eagerly-awaited film based on the hit television series, Homer must save the world from a catastrophe he himself created. It all begins with Homer, his new pet pig, and a leaky silo full of droppings - a combination that triggers a disaster the likes of which Springfield has never experienced. As Marge is outraged by Homer's monumental blunder, a vengeful mob descends on the Simpson household. The family makes a narrow escape, but is soon divided by both location and conflict.

As the fates of Springfield and the world hang in the balance, Homer embarks on a personal odyssey of redemption - seeking forgiveness from Marge, the reunion of his splintered family, and the salvation of his hometown.

  <!-- Here, I put in my video element. I inserted the trailer of the actual film. I inserted the 'controls' button inside the element which means I will be able to click pause and play on the video.
  I also put a poster image in which will act as the front cover for my video. I also put 3 different types of the same video in 3 video formats which were MP3, WEBM, and OGG.
  I put three different video formats in, in case a particular browser does not support one of them. I also included a fallback message for the user, so they know what to do if they can't access the video. -->
